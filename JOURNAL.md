# October 16-17th: Concept UI Art

We started in Figma, making a tiny base, using the resolution of a 7th generation iPod.

We went for using the design language of Apple's *liquid glass* (but the name chnaged in our design for *obvious* reasons xD)

Here's an image of all the UI work done!

**Total Time Spent: ~4.5hrs**
